# Pollen-Profiler

I built a modern, responsive Pollen Classification Web Application using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript with TensorFlow.js for mock AI simulation. The system allows users to upload microscopic images of pollen grains and receive automated predictions and visual feedback based on machine learning inference.

💡 Key Features:
✅ Image Upload via Drag & Drop with real-time preview

🧠 TensorFlow.js Integration to simulate classification results

📊 Detailed Feature Display: Shape, Size, Surface, Apertures, and Texture

🌀 Animated Loading Spinner during ML processing

📋 Classification Results Panel with confidence scores and mock visuals

📚 How It Works Section to explain the process in steps

🎨 Clean UI Design using Tailwind CSS and responsive layout

⚙️ Fully functional with Live Server in VS Code

🔬 Purpose:
This project demonstrates how web technologies can simulate AI-driven biological analysis. It mimics how real-world ML models analyze and classify pollen samples — useful for botanists, ecologists, or students in biology and machine learning fields.
